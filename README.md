# Handwritten_Digit_Detection_Using_DNN_and_CNN

Using the MNIST dataset we will classify handwritten digits images into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, using deep neural network (DNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN). We will compare the results with different loss functions as well as different optimization methods and then choose the best classification model for this dataset.
